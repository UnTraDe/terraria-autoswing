Simple mod for Terraria that removes the need to click repeatly to attack with weapons (AKA auto-reuse)

Works with latest Windows version 1.4.1.1.
You can download it from here: https://github.com/UnTraDe/terraria-autoswing/releases/latest

Works on both mutliplayer and singleplayer, no need to install on server-side.

How to use:

1. Launch Terraria
2. Enter some world
3. Launch terraria-autoswing.exe
4. Wait until:
```
pattern found, nopping...
done
```

Have fun!

(Note: After you done this once, you don't need to do it again even if you switch worlds. But you do need to do it again if you exit Terraria completely)

Disclaimer: Since this method is using memory editing (similiar to what a lot of hacks are doing), it might be detected by anti-cheat protections like VAC and would result in ban. As far as I know VAC is not enabled for Terraria. I tried it myself on my Steam version and nothing happened, but just to be safe, I don't take any responsibility on what might happen.
